In my Netflix dashboard, I tried to think of moblie first, and make it responsive to the browser window size. It's not perfect but I am starting to understand better how to program a more responsive page. To set it up you just need to open the files and then it should run good. The special features that this website has arn't much but I changed the navigation bar on the left, since the one in the mock up design was a little bit small and just looked off porportional.
